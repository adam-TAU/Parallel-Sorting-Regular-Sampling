# Parallel-Sorting-Regular-Sampling

A Parallel Sorting By Regular Sampling algorithm, implemented using OpenMP. <br>
The number of processors is variable.
To run the program, do the following

```
cd assign
build
./parsort <processors|hardware_threads> <filename_to_sort>
```

Note that the program accepts unsigned long integers only (I.E. 64 bit numbers)
